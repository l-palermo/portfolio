## Software Design Choices

### Correct Semantic and HTML Structure

Regardless of how your page looks, the HTML needs to follow specific criteria to provide a pleasant experience to end users, especially those with accessibility needs. CSS is a great tool to style elements and achieve the desired design while keeping the HTML structured properly.

### REM Units over Pixels

I'm a strong advocate for accessibility and responsive design. Using REM units instead of pixels is beneficial for all users, as it allows those who need to increase the browser font size to do so without affecting the layout and design negatively.
